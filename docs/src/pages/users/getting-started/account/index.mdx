# How to create an account or reset your password

<p class="lead">On this page, you will find instructions on how to create an account for OCCRP Aleph and how to reset your password.</p>

<Callout>
  This page describes how to create an account on [aleph.occrp.org](https://aleph.occrp.org), an Aleph instance operated by the OCCRP. If your organization runs its own in-house Aleph instance, the process might be different.

## Create an account
<Steps>
  <Step>
    To create an Aleph account, go to [aleph.occrp.org](https://aleph.occrp.org/) and click on <AnnotationRef>Sign In</AnnotationRef> in the upper right-hand corner.

      />
    </Annotations>
  </Step>


  <Step>
    You will be redirected to the **OCCRP Secure Sign-in** page. Once there, click on <AnnotationRef>New user? Register</AnnotationRef>.

      />
    </Annotations>
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Aleph will ask you for an e-mail address and a password, among other information. Subsequently, you will receive an e-mail confirming that your account has been created. Click on the link received to complete the e-mail verification process. 
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Now, try logging in to your new account with the e-mail and password you chose. For security reasons, Aleph requires you to have an authentication application installed, which works as a two-step verification to log in to the account. We recommend using the free **Google Authenticator** application, which can be downloaded directly from your device’s app store.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Within the app, click on the **+** symbol followed by **Scan a QR code** and scan the <AnnotationRef>QR code</AnnotationRef> displayed on your screen.

  <Step>
    Go to [aleph.occrp.org](https://aleph.occrp.org) and click on **Sign In** in the upper right-hand corner.

        height="5%"
      />
    </Annotations>

    On a new screen, Aleph will ask you to enter your e-mail address (the e-mail address you used to register on the platform).

    <Image src="/assets/pages/users/getting-started/account/reset.png" density={2} />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    You will then receive an e-mail titled **Link to reset credentials**. When you click on it, a new screen will open asking you to scan a code with the app you used when you created your user (e.g. **Google Authenticator**). Then enter the code provided by the app (**One-time code** field) and finally define a name for the phone you are using (**Device name** field). You can put any name (please remember it), that's all!
