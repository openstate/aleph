# Creating your investigation workspace

<p class="lead">This page explains how your can create your own investigation workspace and (optionally) share it with colleagues and other collaborators.</p>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    There are two ways to create your own investigation workspace in Aleph. You can either click on the **Investigations** button in the top menu bar:

    <Image
      src="/assets/pages/users/investigations/create/navbar.png"
      density={2}
    />

    Or you can use the **Investigations** button located on the left sidebar of the homepage.

    <Image
      src="/assets/pages/users/investigations/create/homepage.png"
      density={2}
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Once you click on **New Investigation**, the following window will pop-up:

    <Image
      src="/assets/pages/users/investigations/create/dialog.png"
      density={2}
    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Please fill in the required fields. That is, assign a name to the project or research, add a description and specify the languages of the documents in the **Languages** field. Specifying a language helps Aleph extract text from uploaded documents with higher accuracy, especially if the documents contain text in non-Latin characters.
    
    When you create an investigation workspace, its contents are by default accessible to you and no one else. However, In the **Share with** field you can enter the Aleph user e-mails of the colleagues you want to share the investigation with.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click **Save**.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    After that, you will be redirected to your new investigation workspace:

    <Image
      src="/assets/pages/users/investigations/create/empty-investigation.png"
      density={2}
    />

    The options in the center of the screen tell us what we can do in our own investigation workspace:

    * Upload documents
    * Create new entities (names of people or companies that we want to cross-reference against Aleph datasets to find matches)
    * Create network diagrams
    * Compare our lists against the datasets to which our profile has access

  </Step>
</Steps>
