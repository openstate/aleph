# Manage access to your investigation
 
<p class="lead">After creating your investigation workspace, access can easily be expanded to any co-collaborators you would like to include in your investigation.</p>

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click on the **Gear icon** in the top right corner of the screen to open the **Access control** settings. In the dropdown menu, click on **Share**.

    />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    The access control window will then appear, allowing you to share your investigation workspace with other individuals or groups you are a part of.
    
    Keep in mind that an individual must first have a user account on Aleph to receive access to an investigation workspace. Sharing an investigation with a group means that any user in that group will receive the access you are granting.

    * **View access** allows you to browse the contents of an investigation workspace but not create, edit, or delete anything contained within.
    * **Edit access** allows you full privileges to modify its contents.
